"Life on Mars? This space-age plant looks like she comes from a galaxy far, far away. Bali is rooted in a lava rock, which makes her extra easy to care for -- pretty cool, right? This method of growing scheffleras is becoming ever-more popular, and it looks cool to boot. All you need to do is keep her in water and let this space cadet do her thing.",

"QUICK FACTS",
"<strong>Botanical name:</strong>Schefflera Nora</br><strong>Nickname:</strong>Life on Lava, Lava Rock, Umbrella Tree</br><strong>Plant type:</strong>Evergreen perennial / indoor</br><strong>Toxic?:</strong>Toxic to pets</br><strong>Current Height (including pot):</strong>30cm</br><strong>Pro level:</strong>Easy</br>Bali comes with a tray and so does not need a pot or any soil.",

"HOW TO CARE FOR BALI (LIFE ON LAVA)",
"Keep Bali's tray full of water at all times - she'll soak it right up. No need to water her from the top. Bali isn't a fan of tap water as the limescale turns her rock white, so we always suggest using distilled or filtered water.</br>Keeping Bali at a spot that has plently of indirect light will ensure that she thrives!</br>She likes a bit of humidity, so try spritzing her leaves every so often with a plant mister. You can also try the other recommended methods for increasing humidity in our Care Guide."
